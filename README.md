# miko-bot

The main motive behind this project was to learn Flask app deployment with AWS.

Facebook's API is actually very restrictive when it comes to chatbots (for obvious reasons). You effectively can't implement a chatbot that would be serving your main account, only the "business-like" accounts. Hence I had to create my business account - a hot-dog stand.

I used https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/facebook-chatbot-python-deploy code for verifying the webhook and sending POST requests. In the next iteration, I want to integrate a Rasa bot once I get more comfortable with a framework.

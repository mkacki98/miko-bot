TODO

* figure out how to send a triggering message at a certain time with FB API
* change the app so that it rememebers the past messages sent and can stop the conversation etc. (not only 1 message sender)
* get IDs of my friends and populate the birthday dictionary
* take the app live to enable requests from users that are not myself

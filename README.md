# miko-bot

The main motive behind this project was to learn Flask app deployment with AWS. 

I used https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/facebook-chatbot-python-deploy code for verifying the webhook and sending POST requests.

In the next iteration, I want to integrate a Rasa bot once I get more comfortable with a framework.

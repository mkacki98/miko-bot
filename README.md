# miko-bot

The main motive behind this project was to learn Flask app deployment with AWS. I used https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/facebook-chatbot-python-deploy code for verifying the webhook and sending POST requests.

Initially, I got inspired by Gilfoyle's AI and I wanted to deploy something useful that would trick my friends. Meta's API does not make it easy on Messenger. I may update the bot to a Rasa bot once I get more comfortable with the framework.
